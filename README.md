# libpqtypes

This is a fork of the official libpqtypes repository. 
The reason for creating this fork is a slow reaction from libpqtypes developers to newly found bugs. 
At the moment of creation (22-Jan-2016) this repository contains version 1.5.2 which features a few critical bugfixes (the list of bug fixes TBA) on top of the 
latest official version 1.5.1.
